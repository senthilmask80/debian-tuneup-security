Debian11, Server, RKHunter to check for malwares and corruptions

RKHunter installation and configuration to check for critical files changes against automatic snapshots and for known rootkits. It also checks for processus with open descriptor on deleted files, for binaries which are actually scripts, … This helps to detect when a system was compromised.

RKHunter presentation

rkhunter means Root Kit Hunter. A Root kit is a set of programs installed by crackers when they manage to penetrate a system. It can be installed by viruses also. These programs are meant to send information from the infected system to the cracker’s machines or to execute any arbitrary command on behalf of the infected system owner’s. RKHunter has a database of known root kits and searches for any trace of these rootkits. It also takes fingerprints of critical system programs to detect any change. It automates the snapshots with apt at each package installation. It sends email notifications to the administrators when something was detected. I use RKHunter for the root kit database, I’ll install another tool, tripwire for the critical files alteration detection in the next post.
Prerequisites

This article only depends on the Generic machine preparation post serie.
RKHunter installation

I first give to debconf the answers to the questions which will be asked by the package at installation. I want RKHunter to be executed every day to check my filesystem, I want it to update the vulnerabilities database automatically and I want it to be automatically executed after each package installation to take a fingerprint of the supposed-clean package files. This last one can be dangerous if you use apt to install, upgrade or remove a package, it will automatically trigger a new snapshot and will legitimate current files. This is my choice for my architecture and I know what I’m doing on my servers, be sure to understand before applying.

echo 'rkhunter rkhunter/cron_daily_run boolean true' | debconf-set-selections
echo 'rkhunter rkhunter/cron_db_update boolean true' | debconf-set-selections
echo 'rkhunter rkhunter/apt_autogen boolean true' | debconf-set-selections
apt-get install -y rkhunter

Configuration
Configure email notifications

RKHunter will send email notifications when something goes wrong during either a filesystem check or a vulnerability database update. Thus, I need to configure the email address and email command to send emails. Whatever happen, it also sends the details by email in another message.

sed -i 's/#\?MAIL-ON-WARNING=.*/#MAIL-ON-WARNING=root@localhost/' /etc/rkhunter.conf
sed -i 's/#\?MAIL_CMD=.*"/MAIL_CMD=mail -s "[rkhunter] Warnings found for \${HOST_NAME}"/' /etc/rkhunter.conf

Configure database update

RKHunter needs to update its known vulnerability database from time to time. I configure the download tool to use, the email notifications and I enable this automatic updates.

sed -i 's/#\?WEB_CMD=.*/WEB_CMD=wget/' /etc/rkhunter.conf
sed -i 's/DB_UPDATE_EMAIL=".*"/DB_UPDATE_EMAIL="true"/' /etc/default/rkhunter
sed -i 's/#\?UPDATE_MIRRORS=.*/UPDATE_MIRRORS=1/' /etc/rkhunter.conf
sed -i 's/#\?MIRRORS_MODE=.*/MIRRORS_MODE=0/' /etc/rkhunter.conf

Ignore known false positives

After bedtesting in a closed environment, I listed all the alerts relative to a normal activity and adjusted the configuration to tell RKHunter that these alerts are normal and should not trigger warnings. The last one is because I do accept direct root connections with a key. You might not.

echo 'ALLOWPROCDELFILE=/usr/sbin/cron' >> /etc/rkhunter.conf
echo 'ALLOWPROCDELFILE=/usr/bin/dash' >> /etc/rkhunter.conf
echo 'ALLOWPROCDELFILE=/usr/bin/run-parts' >> /etc/rkhunter.conf
echo 'SCRIPTWHITELIST=/usr/bin/egrep' >> /etc/rkhunter.conf
echo 'SCRIPTWHITELIST=/usr/bin/fgrep' >> /etc/rkhunter.conf
echo 'SCRIPTWHITELIST=/usr/bin/which' >> /etc/rkhunter.conf
echo 'PORT_PATH_WHITELIST=/usr/sbin/portsentry' >> /etc/rkhunter.conf
echo 'ALLOW_SSH_ROOT_USER=prohibit-password' >> /etc/rkhunter.conf

Miscellaneous configuration

I also uncomment the dhclient line, because it was relevant in some cases, but you can keep it commented if you dont use dhclient. I activate the whole test suite and activate the SSH protocol version check, v1 should not be allowed, it is disabled and should remain disabled !

sed -i 's~#\?ALLOWPROCLISTEN=/sbin/dhclient~ALLOWPROCLISTEN=/sbin/dhclient~' /etc/rkhunter.conf
sed -i 's/^DISABLE_TESTS/#&/' /etc/rkhunter.conf
sed -i 's/^#\?PKGMGR=.*/PKGMGR=DPKG/' /etc/rkhunter.conf
sed -i 's/^#\?\(ALLOW_SSH_PROT_V1\)=.*/\1=0/' /etc/rkhunter.conf

Open IPTables for updates

RKHunter needs to update its vulnerabilities database. We configured an automatic update and it needs to download files from Internet but the IPTables firewall blocks outgoing traffic by default, if not explicitely allowed. Thus, we need to create a new chain to list the RKHunter repositories IP addresses and to include this chain in the WAN_output validation chain :

sed -i 's/^-N WAN_input$/-N RKHunterRepositories\n-A RKHunterRepositories -d 216.105.38.10 -j ACCEPT\n\n&/' /etc/iptables/rules.v4
sed -i 's/^-N WAN_output$/&\n-A WAN_output -p tcp --dport 80 --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -j RKHunterRepositories/' /etc/iptables/rules.v4
systemctl restart netfilter-persistent

Update the malware database

Now, we can initiate the first database update manually to check the firewall rules and be sure that automatic updates will succeed.

rkhunter --update

Initial snapshot of system files

It is time to take a snapshot of the sytem files. RKHunter will compute hashes for critical files in the system and store the hashes. It is configured to execute this snapshot after each package upgrade, install or removal in the apt suite, to keep the hashes database up-to-date. Then, the file alteration check is configured to be executed everyday. Anyway, I’ll also install tripwire for this specific task, in the next post of this blog serie.

rkhunter --propupd

Test
Test check

Let’s execute a full test, with realtime colored output !

rkhunter -c --enable all --disable none --skip-keypress

Email test

Let’s execute a faster test, with email notification to check that the notifications are also working.

/etc/cron.daily/rkhunter


rkhunter software

rkhunter – rkhunter (Rootkit Hunter) is a Unix-based tool that scans for rootkits, backdoors and possible local exploits. rkhunter is a shell script which carries out various checks on the local system to try and detect known rootkits and malware. It also performs checks to see if commands have been modified, if the system startup files have been modified, and various checks on the network interfaces, including checks for listening applications. Type the following command to install rkhunter:
$ sudo apt-get install rkhunter

The following command option tells rkhunter to perform various checks on the local system:
$ sudo rkhunter --check

The following command option causes rkhunter to check if there is a later version of any of its text data files:
$ sudo rkhunter --update

The following option tells rkhunter which directories to look in to find the various commands it requires:
$ sudo rkhunter --check --bindir /mnt/safe
